## Mounts... Why?

Suppose we have a network drive mounted with ip-1 (not connected to the VPN). Now if we connect to VPN without unmounting the drive first, mount point won't work as intended because of the public IP change (say ip-2). Changing public IPs like this makes applications running processes dependent on volume and directory end point unusable (fusermount can be used to umount volume in this case).  

### Solution?

Everytime this script is executed (either one), It checks for any mounted volumes (if exists).
- if yes, then it unmounts the drive ‚ñ∂Ô∏è connects to the VPN ‚ñ∂Ô∏è mounts it back.
- if not, then connects to VPN.

This happens when disconnecting from the VPN as well.

## Roadmap

- [x] ~COLORS!~
- [ ] Merge seperate scripts to one
- [ ] reduce keystrokes
- [ ] increase efficiency, (pertaining to the dummy processes used)
