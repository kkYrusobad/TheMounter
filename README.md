# TheMounter

Script that connects me to my own wireguard VPN instance running on cloud without hassel. Also, handles mounted volumes, if any (why? read below).

## Mounts... Why?

Suppose we have a network drive mounted with ip-1 (not connected to the VPN). Now if we connect to VPN without unmounting the drive first, mount point won't work as intended.

### Solution?

Everytime this script is executed (either one), It checks for any mounted volumes (if exists).
- if yes, then it unmounts the drive --> connects to the VPN --> mounts it back.
- if not, then connects to VPN.

This happens when disconnecting from the VPN as well.
